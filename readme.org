#+title: Audio Transcription Service

This project captures audio from an input stream, converts it into a WAV file, 
and transcribes it using the OpenAI API.

** Setup

1. Ensure you have Python 3 installed.
2. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment.
3. Install dependencies:
   #+begin_src bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   #+end_src
4. Create a =.env= file in the project directory with:
   #+begin_src bash
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   #+end_src
5. Adjust the =DEVICE_NAME= constant in the script to match one of your
   available input devices. List your available input devices with this command
   #+begin_src bash
   python -c "import sounddevice as sd; print(sd.query_devices())"
   #+end_src

** Usage

Run the project using:

#+begin_src bash
python main.py
#+end_src

Speak into your microphone and the project will capture 5-second segments of audio, 
transcribe them using the OpenAI API, and print the transcriptions to the terminal.

** Overview

The project uses the following technologies:
- Python 3
- sounddevice for audio capture
- OpenAI API for transcription
- wave and io for audio file handling
