#+title: Audio Transcription Service

This project captures audio from an input stream, converts it into a WAV file, 
and transcribes it using the OpenAI API.

## Overview

The project uses the following technologies:
- Python 3
- sounddevice for audio capture
- OpenAI API for transcription
- wave and io for audio file handling

## Setup

1. Ensure you have Python 3 installed.
2. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment.
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install sounddevice openai python-dotenv
   ```
4. Create a `.env` file in the project directory with:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   ```

## Usage

Run the project using:

    python main.py

Speak into your microphone and the project will capture 5-second segments of audio, 
transcribe them using the OpenAI API, and print the transcriptions to the terminal.

## Troubleshooting

- Verify your audio device names and adjust the DEVICE_NAME setting in main.py if necessary.
- Ensure your API key is correct and you have access to the transcription model.
